# Quantum Computing for Shared Bike Systems

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of Quantum Computing (QC) to optimize shared bike systems. The notebook leverages quantum algorithms to address various challenges in bike sharing systems, such as dynamic rebalancing.

## Overview

The notebook explores different quantum algorithms and methodologies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of bike sharing systems. The methods discussed include Quantum Annealing (QA) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The development and validation of these QC-based methods involve experimentation with real-world datasets.

## Files

- `QC_shared_bike.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the solution.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `dwave-ocean-sdk`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
